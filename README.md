It's a Web site for my practice using Ruby on Rails.


I wanted to check if I can correctly use these functions written below.
1)Correctly connect each pages and each roots.
2)Correctly connect each roots and Controller.
3)Correctly connect each Controller and Views.

If those above are done, I will move to next step.
